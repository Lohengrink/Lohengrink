## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Lohengrink/Lohengrink** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I am interested in using geophysical methods, especially seismic waves, to explore subsurface structures. Currently, I work with Prof. Yunung Nina Lin at the Subsurface Imaging Lab, Institute of Earth Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Our research focuses on the tectonic escape model in the offshore area of southwestern Taiwan using marine multi-channel seismic and sub-bottom profiler data. We also conduct integral interpretation with bathymetry, InSAR, and paleomagnetic data. I have experience in reflection and refraction seismic data processing and enjoy using multi-geophysical data to address geological issues. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, seismic full-waveform inversion. While my experience in those fields is limited, I am eager to expand my knowledge.
- 😁 I am highly interested in reflection seismology, refraction seismology, machine learning, deep learning, full waveform inversion, sub-bottom profiling, and programming languages. I would be delighted to discuss and exchange ideas with you.
- 👯 I am looking for a PhD opportunity.
